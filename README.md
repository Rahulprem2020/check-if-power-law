# check-if-power-law

This is an example showing how we can validate the hypothesis that a distribution follows the power-law. For more details from the theoretical aspects, please refer to the paper "Power-law distributions in empirical data." by Clauset et al. or our slides attached in this github repo.


The python code is in `powerlaw.ipynb`. 
The steps are explained in the slides `Plotting_Power_laws_and_the_Degree_Exponent.pdf`.
The output figures are in `powerlaw_report.pdf`.
